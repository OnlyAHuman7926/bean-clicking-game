# Bean Clicking Game Instructions
If you can't figure out, read this.

## Beans
Beans will appear on the screen, and your objective is to click as many beans as possible. 
When a bean appear, the bean count (similar to health) will typically increase by 10. When the bean count reaches 500, you lose.
When you click a bean, your score increases.

Here's an overview of all beans:
- Normal Bean (green): A normal bean.
- Moving Bean (yellow): Moves in a single direction and bounces off walls. Gives 2 points.
- Orthogonally Moving Bean (also yellow): Moves horizontally and vertically, but changes direction and is faaster than moving beans.
- Healing Bean (light green): Subtracts 50 from the bean count.
- Double Bean (magenta): For 10 seconds, double the score you get from clicking beans. Can stack.
- Freezing Bean (blue): For 5 seconds, make the speed of everything 0.6 times before. Can stack.
- Glass Bean (transparent): Creates a glass wall that blocks dangerous things and make moving beans bounce. The wall has durability.
- Lucky Bean (metallic green): Increases the change for good beans to appear for a while.
- Bullet Bean: Has more health and will shoot bullets at the mouse.
- Black Bean: Shoot grenades at the mouse, has 3 health, and teleports when being clicked. When a black bean's health becomes 0, it explodes, destroying surrounding beans but only taking half the bean count.
- Bronze Bean: A bean.
- Silver Bean: Has 3 health. Increases the speed of the game, but reduces your bean count while it's on the screen.
- Gold Bean: Prevents beans appearing in an area and slows down moving beans in that area. Bullets disappear a while after entering that area. However, it will increase your bean count when it's on the screen.
- Taro Bean: Gives a random effect when clicked. 

## Dangerous Things
Dangerous things are things to dodge. When your mouse touches it, your bean count increases drastically!
(Therefore, touch screens are not allowed, at least for now.)

Overview of all dangerous things:
- Bullet: Constantly flies in a direction. It is fast.
- Moving Dangerous Bean (red): Similar to the moving bean, except it is slower and should not be clicked.
- Explosion: Does area damage. If your cursor is in the explosion range, you will receive huge damage!
- Grenade: Moves in a straight line for a while, and then explodes. There is an indication of the explosion timer.

## Effects
There are various effects in this game.
- Freeze: Slows down the speed of most things like moving and appearing speed.
- Double Points: Doubles the score you get when you click a bean.
- Lucky: Increases the chance of good beans appearing on the screen.
- Shield: Reduces damage received when touching dangerous things. While this effect is on, you cannot lose the game, even if your bean count has exceeded the maximum.
- Distortion: Hope you liked this! :)

## Hard Mode
Hard mode has reduced max bean count. In this mode, bullets move faster, beans appear faster, and dangerous things are more likely to appear.

## Boss Rush
Dodge the boss and the hazards it create.
- Click white beans to fight the boss. They reduce boss health and heal you (-75 bean count).
- Brown beans may sometimes appear, and they explode if you don't click them!
