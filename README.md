# Click Beans 3.0.2

A few months ago, we made Bean Clicking Game 2. However, we wasn’t satisfied with the high complexity of the code. Therefore, we remade one.

This version included lots of new beans and fixed the lag problem in version 2!

## Changelog

3/5: Fixed glass blocks. Now developing boss rush.\
3/10: Boss rush is now playable. Images optimized. Explosion and lucky beans added. Updated sounds.\
3/17: Added grenades and black beans.
5/15: Very few changes. (Sounds in use, unstackable effects, the scale effect, details)

## How to play
Click whatever’s on the screen. Avoid red things. Don't let the bar fill up. That’s it.

Different beans have different behaviors. Finding them out won’t be too difficult.
